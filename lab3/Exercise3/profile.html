            Goku is a boy with a monkey tail. He practiced martial arts hard and has the
            power to transcend ordinary people. Originally believed to be born on Earth,
            Wukong later learned that he was a, a member of an alien militant race,
            and that he was beyond the power of ordinary people. His birth name was Kakarotto.

            As Wukong grew up, he slowly became the strongest warrior on the planet. He vowed
            to protect the earth and defeat those who wanted to hurt it. Goku is portrayed as
            a character who is cheerful and close to others, but often imagines himself
            fighting. He is able to concentrate his temper and use its destructive power and
            then turn into a powerful energy attack.

            qigong fired from Wukong's palm. When it hits an object, it will explode. In
            addition, he has a pure heart, which makes Goku frequently give his enemies a way
            to live, which often earns him some comrades and friends (although it will also
            make his benevolence be used), he is one of the few to ride a flower The man
            named Kinto'un ("The muscles of the clouds", "Flying the clouds")
